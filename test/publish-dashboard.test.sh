# test/publish-dashboard.test.sh — regression tests for
# scripts/publish-dashboard.sh and scripts/publish-dashboard-launcher.sh.
#
# Two behaviours here have already failed in production and one is a scaling
# property, so they get tests rather than a careful reading:
#
#   the launcher's exit   a healthy window must end 0 — its status once came
#                         from the final tick's lock bookkeeping, so
#                         supercronic reported every successful window as a
#                         failure, every five minutes
#   the cost scan         batching must preserve the per-file semantics: the
#                         day cut-off, the model roll-up, tolerance of a torn
#                         envelope mid-write, and unconditional redaction
#   the process budget    a long history must not translate into thousands of
#                         jq forks per publish (tens of seconds under WSL2)
#
# No network and no GitHub: every publish runs --no-github against a
# synthesised state dir (a throwaway HOME, since config.json's state_dir is
# ~-relative). No test framework is used (none exists elsewhere in this
# repo). Run directly:
#
#   ./test/publish-dashboard.test.sh
#
# Exit status is 0 iff every assertion passed.
