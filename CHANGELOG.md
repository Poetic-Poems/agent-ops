## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `config.json`'s `review` block is renamed `project_review` and
  restructured: every tunable now lives under `project_review.defaults`
  (installation-wide) and may be overridden per repository on
  `project_review.repos[]` — each entry `{"slug": "owner/name", ...}` — rather
  than the old flat, installation-wide-only block. An installation with its
  own `config.json` outside this fleet must migrate its `review` block to the
  new shape before upgrading; see `docs/REVIEW-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`'s
  Configuration section for the resolution rule and an example.
