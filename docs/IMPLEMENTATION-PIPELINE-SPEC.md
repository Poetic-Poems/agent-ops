# Hourly Autonomous Implementation Pipeline — as-built specification

## About this document

This is the as-built requirements specification for the hourly implementation
pipeline: the numbered requirements the system satisfies, the components that
satisfy them, the acceptance checks that prove it, and the reasoning behind
them. It describes the system as it exists, and it must keep doing so — any
change to the pipeline lands together with the edit that keeps this document
accurate (see `CLAUDE.md`, "As-built specifications"). Where this document is
silent, follow the conventions of the two target repositories (their
`CLAUDE.md` files are binding on any agent working inside them).

## What it is

A pipeline that, once an hour, picks **at most one** well-scoped item of
pending work from one of two GitHub repositories, implements it on a feature
branch in an ephemeral clone, reviews and corrects the result, and leaves a
mergeable pull request for a human to approve. It runs unattended on the
host machine (WSL2 Ubuntu). The only human involvement is final pull-request
review and merge.

```
cron (hourly)
  └─ agent-cycle.sh                 ← the Script: lock, stand-down checks, repo ordering
       ├─ Co-Ordinator (Haiku)      ← selects ≤ 1 item, emits a work order; nothing else
       ├─ Implementor (Sonnet/Haiku)← ephemeral clone, feature branch, draft PR
       └─ Reviewer (Sonnet)         ← corrects the branch, flips the PR to ready
             └─ Human               ← reviews and merges (the only gate)
```

## Entities

1. The **Cronjob** — the crontab entry that fires the Script.
2. The **Script** (`agent-cycle.sh`) — a bash script that orchestrates one
   whole cycle. It launches every agent; agents never launch other agents.
3. The **Co-Ordinator** — a headless Claude Code invocation that selects one
   item of work and emits a work order. It does not implement anything.
4. The **Implementor** — a headless Claude Code invocation that carries out
   the work order and raises a draft pull request.
5. The **Reviewer** — a headless Claude Code invocation that checks and
   corrects the Implementor's branch, then marks the pull request ready.
6. The **Human Reviewer** — gives final approval and performs the merge on
   every pull request, through the ordinary GitHub process. Not launched by
   any part of this system.

## Environment (verified 2026-07-20)

- WSL2 Ubuntu; `bash`, `git`, `jq` and `gh` available.
- `gh` is authenticated as `warwickallen`, with push access to both target
  repositories.
- The standalone `claude` CLI is installed and resolvable from cron's
  minimal environment.
- `cron` is running (started by WSL's `[boot]` command) with the crontab
  entries installed: the hourly cycle, the daily review tick, and the
  dashboard heartbeat (see `README.md`, "Installation").
- Headless `claude -p` invocations authenticate with the user's existing
  Claude subscription login; `gh` uses its existing token. No new keys.

### The node image (`deploy/docker/`)

The same pipeline also runs from a container image, so a node can be a cloud VM
as readily as the laptop. The image is the *only* deployment artefact: it is
built from this repository, `/app` inside it **is** the deployed agent-ops, and
a node updates by pulling a new image rather than by pulling a branch.

- Base `ubuntu:24.04`, non-root user `agent` (uid/gid from the `PUID`/`PGID`
  build args, default 1000) with `HOME=/home/agent`, so `config.json`'s
  `~`-relative `state_dir` and `workspace_root` resolve under that home.
- Toolchain: `bash`, `git`, `jq`, `curl`, `python3`, `perl`, `coreutils`,
  `flock` and `rsync` (requirement 2.5); `gh` from GitHub's apt repository (the distro package is too old for
  the flags the pipelines use); Node.js from NodeSource at the same major as
  the laptop; the `claude` CLI from `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`; and
  `supercronic`, a pinned release binary verified by SHA-1, which runs the
  container's crontab as an ordinary process with no cron daemon and no root.
- `deploy/docker/entrypoint.sh` runs as `agent` on every container start and is
  idempotent: it seeds `~/.claude/settings.json` from
  `deploy/docker/claude-settings.json` **only when absent** (that directory is a
  persistent volume holding refreshing OAuth credentials, and the seed carries
  model/effort defaults only — no plugins and no local marketplaces), sets the
  git identity from `GIT_USER_NAME`/`GIT_USER_EMAIL`, runs `gh auth setup-git`
  when `GH_TOKEN` is present so https pushes authenticate, creates `state_dir`
  and `workspace_root`, and then execs the service it was given. It refuses to
  start if `state_dir` is not writable, rather than letting a mis-owned volume
  become a silent failure to record anything.
- `deploy/docker/crontab` carries the same three pipeline schedules as the
  laptop crontab, plus a fourth line the laptop has no use for — a
  `state-sync.sh restore` every seven minutes, which keeps a standby node's
  memory current and does nothing at all on the active one (requirement 2.5) — the 5-minute dashboard heartbeat, the hourly cycle, the daily
  review tick — with the same redirections into `state_dir`, so the dashboard's
  log-derived views work identically. It deliberately omits the laptop's
  personal `update-main-branches.sh` entry: that refreshes interactive
  checkouts, and a node has none.
- Nothing host-specific and nothing secret is baked in. `GH_TOKEN`, the Claude
  credentials volume, `NODE_NAME` and `AGENT_OPS_ROLE` all arrive at run time,
  and a node that is not `active` (requirement 2.4) costs nothing but its
  cron-log lines.
- The image is built by CI, not by hand:
  `.github/workflows/build-image.yml` builds it on every pull request and
  every merge, runs the acceptance checks below *inside* it, and — on `main`
  only — publishes it to `ghcr.io/poetic-poems/agent-ops` tagged both `latest`
  (what a node's watchtower follows) and the commit SHA (how a node is pinned
  or rolled back, through `AGENT_OPS_IMAGE`). A pull request builds and tests
  but publishes nothing. This is the whole update path: merge produces an
  image, and nodes replace containers.
- The image creates the volume mount points (`~/.claude`, `state_dir`,
  `workspace_root`) owned by `agent`, because a container runtime seeds a new
  named volume from the image's mount point — ownership included — and creates
  it as root when the image has nothing there.
- The image is x86-64 only, because the pinned `supercronic` asset is
  (`TECH-DEBT.md`, TD26072002).

### The node stack (`deploy/docker/compose.yaml`)

A node is a single Compose project. Every node runs the same file and the same
image; the only thing that differs between two nodes is `deploy/docker/.env` —
its name, its role and its tokens. `deploy/docker/.env.example` documents that
file and carries placeholders only; `.env` itself is never committed.

- **`scheduler`** — `supercronic /app/deploy/docker/crontab`, in no profile, so
  it runs on every node. `AGENT_OPS_ROLE` comes from `ROLE` in `.env` and
  **defaults to `standby`** if unset, so a half-configured node cannot become a
  second worker.
- **`dashboard`** (profile `tailnet`) — `scripts/serve-dashboard.sh` sharing the
  `tailscale` sidecar's network namespace (`network_mode: service:tailscale`).
  That shared namespace is what lets Tailscale Serve reach a server bound to
  `127.0.0.1` while nothing on any network can, so containerisation costs the
  dashboard's privacy model nothing. The sidecar's `ts-serve.json` proxies
  `https://<node>.<tailnet>` to `http://127.0.0.1:8787` and allows no Funnel.
- **`dashboard-local`** (profile `local`) — the same server on a node with no
  tailnet, using the host's network namespace rather than a published port,
  because a published port would reach nothing (`DASHBOARD-SPEC`). The page is
  then readable on that host's loopback and nowhere else. `DASHBOARD_PORT`
  exists because the host may already have something on 8787 — the laptop's
  legacy SysV dashboard does.
- **`watchtower`** (profile `auto-update`) — how a node picks up new code: it
  polls for a new image tag and restarts the services into it. Enabled by
  label, so it touches this stack's containers and no others on the host.
- Which profiles a node runs is set by `COMPOSE_PROFILES` in its `.env`, so the
  operator's command is `docker compose up -d` on every node regardless.
- Three named volumes carry everything that must survive a container being
  replaced: `state` (the node's cycle records, logs and locks), `claude-config`
  (the OAuth credentials, which refresh themselves and cannot be rebuilt from
  the image), and `workspaces`. A node updates by replacing its containers;
  these are what it keeps.
- The dashboard service of either profile `depends_on` the scheduler. Both mount
  the `state` volume, and on a node's first start that volume is empty and is
  seeded from the image's mount point; two containers seeding it at once race,
  and one aborts the `up` with `mkdir … /cycles: file exists`. The dependency
  routes the first-run seed through a single container. On every later start the
  volume already exists, so it only orders startup.

### Target repositories

| Repo | GitHub | Work sources, in priority order |
|---|---|---|
| poetic (framework) | `Poetic-Poems/poetic` | 1. **security findings** · 2. **review-feedback** · 3. failed Actions runs on `main` · 4. `TECH-DEBT.md` · 5. open GitHub issues · 6. project-review recommendations · 7. code-quality findings |
| poetic-fiddle (web app) | `Poetic-Poems/poetic-fiddle` | 1. **security findings** · 2. **review-feedback** · 3. failed Actions runs on `main` · 4. `TECH-DEBT.md` · 5. open GitHub issues · 6. `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` (next milestone task) · 7. project-review recommendations · 8. code-quality findings |

The `security` and `code-quality` sources draw on GitHub's own automated
analysis, not just files in the tree:

- **`security`** — open **Dependabot alerts** (vulnerable dependencies) and
  open **code-scanning alerts** (CodeQL and any other configured code-scanning
  tool) that carry a security severity. All Dependabot alerts are security by
  nature; a code-scanning alert counts here when its
  `security_severity_level` is set. This source is **first in every repo's
  list**, and, more strongly, **any security-related candidate takes
  precedence over every non-security candidate regardless of which source it
  came from** — including a GitHub issue labelled `security`/`vulnerability`
  or a `TECH-DEBT.md` entry flagged as a security concern. Security work is
  always prioritised.
- **`code-quality`** — the remaining open **code-scanning alerts** (those
  *without* a security severity: maintainability, correctness, and style
  findings) plus any other code-quality findings GitHub surfaces. This is the
  lowest-priority source: automated quality suggestions are more speculative
  and higher-volume than curated tech-debt or filed issues, so they are
  picked up only when nothing more deliberate is waiting.

The `project-review` source draws on the weekly project-review pipeline's own
output (see `docs/REVIEW-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`), which lands in each repo via a
merged PR:

- **`project-review`** — the prioritised **recommendations** produced by the
  most recent project review, which live on the default branch under
  `reviews/project-review-YYYY-MM-DD/` as `03-recommendations.md` (the
  recommendation table and per-`R-NN` detail) paired with
  `04-improvement-prompts.md` (one ready-to-run agent prompt per
  recommendation). The Co-Ordinator reads the **latest** review folder's two
  files directly (`gh api .../contents/...`, no pre-fetch needed) and treats
  each recommendation as a candidate. A recommendation's **stable ref** is
  `review-<review-date>-R-NN` (e.g. `review-2026-07-20-R03`); that ref goes in
  the branch and PR so a claim (open PR) and a completion (merged PR) are both
  detectable later. The improvement prompt is the Implementor's brief and the
  recommendation's *Intended end state* is its acceptance. This source sits
  **below tech-debt and issues** deliberately: the review already mirrors its
  debt-shaped recommendations into `TECH-DEBT.md` (cross-referencing the
  `R-NN`), and those curated, status-tracked entries are the primary channel —
  the `project-review` source exists to pick up the review's remaining
  recommendations (typically smaller improvements) that were *not* also filed
  as tech-debt or an issue, so nothing the review surfaced is silently dropped.
  It ranks above `code-quality` because a human-approved review recommendation
  is more deliberate than an automated quality suggestion. A recommendation
  whose text flags a **security concern** is security-related and so is caught
  by "security is always prioritised" like any other security candidate.

Because Dependabot and code-scanning alerts live behind paginated, verbose
GitHub APIs, the Script pre-fetches and normalises them once per cycle via
`scripts/gather-findings.sh` (a deterministic, model-free script) and injects
the compact result into the Co-Ordinator's runtime input, so the Co-Ordinator
does not spend model tokens paginating those endpoints itself (see
requirement 3a and 20).

Conventions shared by both repos (agents must honour all of these):

- `main` is protected: no direct pushes by anyone or anything; every change
  lands via a pull request, squash-merged, so **the PR title becomes the
  commit on `main` and must be in Conventional Commits format**.
- `TECH-DEBT.md` holds deferred work, with a permanent Ledger table and a
  "Claiming an item" workflow: flip the Ledger row to `in-progress` and open
  a **draft** pull request immediately, so the claim is visible; flip to
  `resolved` and mark the PR ready when done. Live item bodies live under a
  `## Current Items` heading (above `## Ledger`) as `### <id> <title>`
  sections — that heading is where a new item's body goes, and a resolved
  item's `### ` section is removed from it while its Ledger row stays forever.
  `scripts/get-tech-debt-record.pl` resolves an ID to its record;
  `scripts/next-tech-debt-id.pl` allocates IDs.
- CI runs on every PR (build/lint/test workflows plus CodeQL and
  commit-format checks). A PR is not finished until its checks pass and
  `gh pr view --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus` reports it mergeable.
- `CHANGELOG.md` gets an entry for notable changes; other docs are as-built
  (no historical phrasing).

## Configuration

One `config.json` at the root of `agent-ops`, holding every tunable. The
values below are the confirmed defaults; the README must document each key.

| Key | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `repos` | `["Poetic-Poems/poetic", "Poetic-Poems/poetic-fiddle"]` | Work-source lists per repo as in the table above (`security`, `review-feedback`, `failed-runs`, `tech-debt`, `issues`, `implementation-plan`, `project-review`, `code-quality`); structure the config so a repo or source can be added without code changes. |
| `state_dir` | `~/.local/state/poetic-agents` | Lock, shared log, per-cycle stage transcripts. |
| `workspace_root` | `~/.cache/poetic-agents/workspaces` | Ephemeral clones live and die here, including the state repository's mirror. |
| `state_repo` | `Poetic-Poems/agent-ops-state` | The private repository through which `state_dir` replicates between nodes (requirement 2.5). Unset means a single-node operation: every mode of `scripts/state-sync.sh` becomes a no-op. |
| `lease_ttl_hours` | 3 h | How long `leader.json` stands before another node may take it. Long enough to outlive one cycle of any plausible length, short enough that a node which dies does not hold the operation down for a working day. |
| `cycles_retained` | 200 | Cycle directories kept in the replicated mirror — about eight days of hourly cycles. Bounds a repository that is force-pushed after every cycle. The node's own `state_dir` is bounded by `state_local_cycles_retained` instead. |
| `state_local_cycles_retained` | 1000 | Cycle and review directories the node's *own* `state_dir` keeps — about six weeks of hourly cycles; the same push that replicates prunes to it (requirement 2.5). Deliberately far above `cycles_retained`, so the local machine is always the longer record, with a floor of one protecting the cycle being recorded. `STATE_SYNC_LOCAL_RETAINED` overrides it for tests. |
| `coordinator_model` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | Selection is cheap triage. |
| `implementor_model_default` | `claude-sonnet-5` | Any change that affects runtime behaviour. |
| `implementor_model_trivial` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | Docs-, comment-, or register-only items. The Co-Ordinator classifies each item and records its reasoning in the work order. |
| `reviewer_model` | `claude-sonnet-5` | |
| `pr_label` | `autonomous-agent` | Applied to every PR this system raises. |
| `branch_prefix` | `agent/` | Branch name `agent/<item-slug>`, e.g. `agent/td26051201-fix-xyz`. |
| `max_open_agent_prs` | `3` | Back-pressure: total open PRs (draft or ready) carrying `pr_label`, across all repos, plus live claim-registry entries (requirement 2.2). |
| `candidates_max` | `3` | How many ranked candidates the Co-Ordinator returns; the Script claims down the list (requirement 17a), so alternates turn a lost race into the next-best item instead of a wasted cycle. |
| `claim_ttl_hours` | `6` | Age beyond which `lib/claim.sh gc` sweeps a claim-registry entry — far beyond a whole cycle (90 min Implementor + 30 min Reviewer), so only a dead node's claim ever expires. The branch itself is deleted only if untouched and PR-less. |
| `timeout_coordinator` | 15 min | Per-stage wall-clock timeouts, enforced by the Script. |
| `timeout_implementor` | 90 min | |
| `timeout_reviewer` | 30 min | |
| `lock_stale_after` | 3 h | Greater than the sum of the stage timeouts plus slack. |
| `disable_default_ttl` | 4 h | How long `--disable` lasts when `--for` doesn't say (requirement 2.3). Long enough to cover an editing session, short enough that a forgotten switch costs a few cycles rather than every future one. |
| `none_selected_recheck_hours` | 24 h | The no-op short-circuit's safety valve (requirement 3b): the Co-Ordinator is engaged regardless once the last `none-selected` is this old, even if nothing changed. Bounds how long a gap in fingerprint coverage can stall the pipeline. `0` disables the valve — don't. |
| `limit_cooldown_default` | 3 h | Stand-down period after an ordinary/transient usage-limit error whose reset time cannot be parsed. A weekly/monthly match with no parseable reset time uses the longer `LIMIT_LONG_COOLDOWN_HOURS` fallback in `lib/limit-detect.sh` instead (see requirement 10) — not this key. |

Model IDs are pinned in config (one place to update); do not use floating
aliases in the launch commands.

## The Human Gate

The only branch this system protects is each repository's default branch.
No agent may push to it, or approve or merge a pull request targeting it —
GitHub's branch protection enforces this anyway. A human does both, on every
PR this system raises.

Every other branch **created by this system** (i.e. under `branch_prefix`)
is entirely at the agents' disposal: the Reviewer may amend, add to, rebase,
or force-push such a branch as it judges best. Agents must not rewrite
branches outside `branch_prefix` — those belong to humans, and the target
repos' own rule (force-pushing requires explicit instruction) applies.

The Reviewer's purpose is to spend cheap model time so that the Human
Reviewer's time is spent on work that is already close to mergeable. The
human gate is the only point at which a human is required; everything else
runs unattended.

## Requirements

### The Script (`agent-cycle.sh`)

1. **Lock.** On start, acquire a lock file in `state_dir` recording PID and
   start time. If the lock is held by a live process younger than
   `lock_stale_after`, log `cycle-skipped` and exit 0. If the holder is dead
   or older than `lock_stale_after`, kill its whole process group if still
   alive, log a `warning` (a stale cycle indicates a fault — it should not
   occur in normal operation), take the lock, and continue.
2. **Stand-down checks.** Each check logs its reason and exits cleanly:
   1. *Usage-limit cooldown*: if the shared log's most recent `limit-hit`
      event has a `resume_at` still in the future, stand down.
   2. *Back-pressure*: if the number of open PRs labelled `pr_label` across
      all configured repos (drafts included), **plus the live claim-registry
      entries for those repos** (requirement 17a — work a node has claimed
      but not yet surfaced as a PR; each entry is dropped the moment its PR
      exists), is ≥ `max_open_agent_prs`, stand down. This is the primary
      throttle on both spend and on the human gate silting up. The count is
      approximate by design: N nodes can pass it simultaneously, so the
      stated bound is `max_open_agent_prs + (nodes − 1)`, transient.
2.2a. **Back-pressure throttles starting work, not finishing it.** Compute the
   count in 2.2 but **defer the stand-down** until the sources are gathered
   (requirement 3c). If back-pressure has tripped *and* any `review_feedback`
   candidate exists, do not stand down: restrict every repo's `sources` to
   `["review-feedback"]` and continue. Only stand down when the count is over
   and nothing is waiting on us.

   Without this the pipeline deadlocks exactly when it is most stuck.
   `max_open_agent_prs` PRs all sitting on "changes requested" is a state the
   system can only escape by answering them — and the plain check stands the
   cycle down before the Co-Ordinator ever runs, so the one source that could
   clear them is never reached. The pipeline dies silently, and the fix
   (merge or close something by hand) is invisible unless you already know.

   The restriction preserves back-pressure's stated purpose exactly: the system
   still cannot open a *new* PR while the gate is full; it can only finish what
   is already in it, which is the one activity that *un*-silts the gate.
   Implement it by narrowing the `sources` lists rather than by adding a mode
   flag: the Co-Ordinator is already told the runtime input's `sources` are
   authoritative over its own table (requirement 15), so a source it cannot see
   is a source it cannot select — no new prompt concept, and nothing for it to
   reason around.
2.3. **The switch.** A file, `state_dir/disabled.json`, whose presence stops
   cycles starting. Checked *before* the lock and before any `gh` call — a
   disabled pipeline should cost nothing — and honoured by both this Script and
   `review-cycle.sh` (`docs/REVIEW-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`, R2a) through one shared
   implementation (requirement 34a), with `agent-cycle.sh` the only writer.
   Managed by three flags that manage the switch and run no cycle:
   `--disable [<reason>] [--for <90m|4h|2d|forever>]`, `--enable`, `--status`.
   Transitions are logged (`disabled`, `enabled`).

   **Why it exists.** Both cron pipelines execute code out of the agent-ops
   working tree. An agent editing `agent-cycle.sh`, `lib/` or `prompts/` is
   editing the files the next tick will source; a cycle firing mid-edit runs
   half of one revision and half of another, and the resulting failure gets
   attributed to whatever the agent happened to be writing. That is also why
   the switch is shared rather than per-pipeline: the weekly review runs out of
   the same tree and sources the same `lib/`, so a switch that stood down only
   the implementation pipeline would leave the hazard in place.

   Four details decide whether this helps or becomes its own outage:
   - **A disable expires** after `disable_default_ttl` unless it explicitly
     says `forever`. The switch's whole risk is that it is a deliberate,
     silent, total stop: an agent that sets it and then dies — killed, timed
     out, context exhausted, or simply finished and forgetful — has stopped
     every future cycle, and nothing will alert, because "no PRs" is what a
     working pipeline looks like on a quiet week. A TTL turns "forgot to
     re-enable" into a few lost cycles. This is the stale-lock rule of
     requirement 1 applied to the same failure.
   - **Everything ambiguous resolves toward disabled.** An unreadable record,
     or one whose `expires_at` won't parse, keeps the pipeline down. The file
     exists because something meant to stop the pipeline; recovering "enabled"
     from a truncated write runs the cycle the switch was set to prevent.
   - **A reason is required, and an unparseable `--for` is an error.** The next
     person to wonder why nothing is happening is entitled to a reason, and a
     typo'd duration must not be guessed in either direction — one resumes the
     pipeline mid-edit, the other never resumes it.
   - **The switch stops the next cycle, not the one already running.** Say so
     when it is set while a lock is held, in `--status` and in `--disable`'s own
     output. An agent that disables the pipeline, assumes the coast is clear and
     starts editing has gained nothing and doesn't know it.

   Deliberately *not* bypassed by `--once` or `--dry-run`: "these files are
   being edited, do not run them" is no less true when a human runs them.
2.4. **The role guard.** The environment variable `AGENT_OPS_ROLE` names the
   one node that runs unattended cycles. Compared case-insensitively and
   ignoring surrounding whitespace against the single value `active`;
   **anything else — unset, empty, misspelt, or a word from some other
   vocabulary — is a standby**, and a standby exits 0 after writing one line to
   stdout (which cron redirects into `cron.log`) naming the role it saw.

   Checked *before the configuration is read*, and therefore before the lock,
   the log and the cycle directory: a standby tick must leave no trace in
   `state_dir` at all. That is stricter than the switch, which logs its
   stand-down, and deliberately so — a standby's `state_dir` holds no work of
   its own, so an hourly event written there is noise in a stream that is
   otherwise a record of cycles, and an hourly empty cycle directory is
   indistinguishable from a cycle that died before it logged anything.

   Bypassed by `--dry-run` and `--once`, which are a human asking for a cycle
   rather than an unattended one, and by `--disable`/`--enable`/`--status`,
   which manage shared state and must answer on every node. Not bypassed by
   `--repo`, which narrows an otherwise ordinary cycle. The switch is checked
   *after* the guard, so a standby node neither logs nor clears it: the record
   belongs to the active node, and expiry is its business to notice.

   **Why fail-closed.** The pipelines are meant to run on several machines
   (the laptop and any number of cloud nodes) with exactly one spending. The
   two mistakes are not symmetric: a node wrongly standby costs one skipped
   cycle, visible on the dashboard within the hour and fixed by one variable; a
   second node wrongly active opens competing pull requests for the same item,
   pays for both, and leaves a mess in the target repos for a human to
   untangle. So the guard resolves every ambiguity toward standby, exactly as
   requirement 2.3 resolves every ambiguity toward disabled. The guard is a
   local, zero-cost check, not a distributed lock: it stops a misconfigured
   node, not two nodes both deliberately configured as active.

   Implemented in `lib/role.sh`, shared with `review-cycle.sh`
   (`docs/REVIEW-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`, R2b) so "active" has one definition.
2.5. **State replication and the lease.** The pipelines' memory —
   `state_dir` — is replicated between nodes through the private repository
   named by `state_repo`, by `scripts/state-sync.sh`. Every mode of that script
   is a silent no-op when `state_repo` is unset, so a single-node operation
   behaves exactly as it did before the fleet existed.

   **What replicates.** Everything under `state_dir` except the live locks
   (`lock.json`, `review-lock.json`), the dashboard's own machinery
   (`dashboard/`, `dashboard.log`, `dashboard-server.log`,
   `.dashboard-github.json`), `state-sync.log`, and `leader.json`. The
   exclusions are not tidiness: a restored `lock.json` is a lock no process
   holds, and would stand every later cycle down until it went stale; the
   dashboard is generated from the state beside it, so copying it would be
   copying a derivative of what is already being copied. `log.jsonl`,
   `review-log.jsonl`, `cycles/`, `reviews/`, `disabled.json` and the cron logs
   do replicate — they are what makes a spare node warm rather than merely
   installed. Git stores no empty directories, so a cycle that stood down
   before its first stage replicates as its `log.jsonl` entry alone.

   **Push.** The active node mirrors `state_dir` into the state repository at
   the *end* of a cycle, from the same cleanup that releases the lock: a
   half-written cycle replicated to every standby is worse than a complete one
   that arrives an hour later. It is a single rolling commit — `commit --amend`
   plus a force-push — because the state files carry their own history
   (`log.jsonl` is append-only, every cycle keeps its own directory) and a
   commit per push would be a second, redundant history whose only lasting
   effect is a repository that grows without bound. The mirror keeps the newest
   `cycles_retained` cycle directories. The node's own history is bounded
   separately, by the same push and before any mirroring: local `cycles/` and
   `reviews/` are pruned to the newest `state_local_cycles_retained` each — a
   deliberately longer record than the mirror's, so everything the mirror
   wants is always still on disk and the machine remains the fuller history of
   the two, with a floor of one so the cycle being recorded is always kept. A
   push that finds nothing changed does not force-push, though it still
   prunes.

   **Restore.** A standby node mirrors the repository back into its `state_dir`
   from its own schedule. It is a mirror, not a merge: a cycle pruned upstream
   goes here too. It is a no-op on the active node — restoring onto the source
   of truth would overwrite the cycle it is in the middle of recording — and
   silent when nothing changed, because it runs every few minutes on every
   standby node and a log of "nothing happened" is a log nobody reads.

   **The lease.** `leader.json` at the root of the state repository —
   `{"node": …, "updated": …}` — records which node is running, and is taken
   after the lock and before any work. If it names another node and was
   refreshed less than `lease_ttl_hours` ago, this cycle logs a stand-down and
   exits 0; otherwise this node claims or refreshes it. The write is a
   compare-and-set on the file's blob sha, so two nodes claiming at once
   produces one winner and one stand-down. It is read and written through the
   REST contents API rather than the mirror, because a check that happens
   before a cycle does anything should cost one request rather than a clone;
   for the same reason it is excluded from the mirroring, which would otherwise
   delete it. `--dry-run` and `--once` take no lease, and therefore also push
   nothing.

   **Why the lease fails open.** A node that cannot reach GitHub for a moment
   proceeds, with a warning. This is the opposite choice to requirement 2.4,
   and deliberately: the role guard is a local, deterministic check where
   ambiguity means misconfiguration, while the lease depends on the network,
   where ambiguity means weather. Failing closed there would let one failed
   request stop the whole operation, quietly, while looking healthy — and the
   cost of being wrong is bounded, because duplicating work needs a *second*
   node already deliberately configured active. The lease is the safety net
   under the role guard, not a replacement for it.
3. **Repo ordering.** For each configured repo, fetch the timestamp of the
   most recent commit on its default branch via `gh api`; sort least recent
   first. The most-overdue repo gets first look, and this ordering takes
   precedence over the per-repo source priorities.
3a. **Findings pre-fetch (cost control).** For each configured repo whose
   `sources` include `security` or `code-quality`, run
   `scripts/gather-findings.sh <repo-slug>` — a deterministic script that uses
   `gh api` to pull the repo's open Dependabot alerts and open code-scanning
   alerts, normalises each into a compact finding (`source` of `security` or
   `code-quality`, a `security` boolean, `severity`, a stable `ref`, `title`,
   `url`, and location/package), and prints them as a JSON array. It must
   degrade to `[]` (and exit 0) when a repo has the feature disabled or the
   token lacks access, so a missing feature never fails the cycle. Attach each
   repo's array to that repo's entry in the Co-Ordinator's runtime input as
   `findings`. Doing this in the Script — not in the Co-Ordinator — spends no
   model tokens on paginating and digesting those verbose APIs.
3c. **Review-feedback pre-fetch (requirement 3c).** For each configured repo
   whose `sources` include `review-feedback`, run
   `scripts/gather-review-feedback.sh <slug> <pr_label> <branch_prefix>` and
   attach the array to that repo's entry as `review_feedback`. It prints the
   PRs *waiting on us to answer a human's review*: open, non-draft, carrying
   `pr_label`, head branch under `branch_prefix`, `reviewDecision` of
   `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, and — the load-bearing clause — **the latest review is
   newer than the head commit**. Each entry carries every review body and
   inline comment in the round, verbatim.

   - **The turn rule is the whole feature.** This system raises PRs as the
     account it runs as, and GitHub forbids approving or dismissing a review on
     your own PR. So the agent *cannot* clear `CHANGES_REQUESTED`; it stays set
     after the fix is pushed, and nothing about the PR's own state ever says
     "answered". Comparing the latest review against the head commit is the only
     thing that does. Without it every PR the agent fixed would stay a candidate
     forever — selected, re-fixed, re-selected, hourly, each cycle looking like
     a productive one and each paying a Sonnet run to redo work already pushed.
     Same shape as requirement 15's "a later green run supersedes".
   - **Gather every review in the round, not just the blocking one.** The
     substance and the formal signal routinely live in different reviews by
     different accounts, precisely *because* an author cannot request changes on
     their own PR. Observed here: the agent's account left a 6.5 KB `COMMENTED`
     review with every actual finding, and the human's second account posted the
     `CHANGES_REQUESTED` whose body reads, in full, "Refer to <link>". Gather
     only the blocker and the Implementor receives the words "Refer to".
   - **The ref is `pr-<n>-review-<review-id>`, not `pr-<n>`.** A blocked item
     (requirement 34) stays blocked until cleared, so a bare `pr-57` the
     Implementor once failed on would still be blocked when the human posted
     fresh guidance, and that guidance would land on a dead item. Per-round refs
     expire by irrelevance, like the review-dated `review-<date>-R-NN` refs.
   - **Only branches under `branch_prefix`.** The Human Gate reserves every
     other branch for humans; "they asked for changes" is not licence to push to
     a colleague's PR.
   - Fails safe to `[]` (exit 0). But show `gh`'s stderr: a rejected `--json`
     field name (`headRefOid` does not exist in every `gh`) otherwise degrades
     to an empty array indistinguishable from "nothing is under review", and the
     source silently never fires. That cost a debugging round when this was
     built.
3b. **No-op short-circuit (cost control).** The Co-Ordinator costs the same to
   say "nothing to do" as it does to select work. On a quiet week that is 24
   identical answers a day, every one of them paid for. Before launching it,
   compute a **fingerprint** of every input its verdict depends on; if the most
   recent `none-selected` event carries the same fingerprint and is younger
   than `none_selected_recheck_hours`, log `stand-down` with the reason and the
   fingerprint, and exit without launching anything.

   The claim this makes is deliberately narrow, and stating it precisely is
   what keeps it safe: *every input is byte-identical to when it last declined,
   therefore its verdict would be the same*. It is **not** the claim "there is
   no work" — nobody but the Co-Ordinator can know that, and avoiding asking it
   is the entire point. The rule never has to be right about the repository,
   only about whether anything moved.

   - **The fingerprint must cover every input, or the pipeline silently
     stalls.** A source left out is a source that can gain work without waking
     the pipeline, and the symptom is nothing at all: no error, no failed
     stage, just tidy `stand-down` events and no PRs. Map each source to a
     signal and keep the map in the shared library: `head_sha` covers every
     file-backed source at once (tech-debt, implementation-plan,
     project-review, the code); the pre-fetched `findings` cover security and
     code-quality verbatim; an issues digest (number, `updated_at`, labels,
     assignee — the last two because requirement 16.4 excludes on them); a
     workflows digest for failed-runs; an open-PR digest, because a PR is a
     claim (16.3) and closing one creates a candidate while touching no commit,
     issue or alert; the `blocked`/`void` extracts projected to `repo|item`, so
     a human's hand-appended `unblocked` takes effect; and — the two everyone
     forgets — the selection config and a hash of `prompts/coordinator.md`.
     Without those last two, editing the selection rules does nothing until an
     unrelated commit lands, and you spend the afternoon debugging an edit that
     was correct.
   - **Digest what the verdict reads, not what merely changed.** Requirement 15
     makes a failed run a candidate when a workflow's *most recent run is a
     failure* — a fact about the conclusion. Digesting run ids instead makes
     every scheduled workflow bust the fingerprint on its own cadence.
     `poetic` schedules `sync-framework.yml` at `0 * * * *`: hourly, the same
     cadence as this pipeline. That one workflow reduced the entire
     short-circuit to a no-op that still paid for a Co-Ordinator every hour —
     installed, logged, green, and saving nothing. Digest conclusions, and drop
     runs still in flight (a run in progress is not yet a failure, and sampling
     one mid-flight registers two changes for a workflow that ends where it
     began).
   - **A sample that failed is not a sample.** The signals this rule needs
     beyond the Co-Ordinator's own runtime input are proxies for reads *it*
     performs, so they must be gathered by a deterministic script
     (`scripts/gather-source-state.sh`) that marks `ok: false` on any API
     error. An unfingerprintable cycle simply runs the Co-Ordinator. This is
     the one place the `[]`-on-failure convention of requirement 3a must not be
     copied: `gather-findings.sh` may degrade, because its output *is* the
     Co-Ordinator's input and a fingerprint recording "no findings" faithfully
     records what the model saw. A failing issues API degrading to `[]` would
     instead be a stable lie — it would match the next equally-failed sample
     and skip, and go on skipping for as long as the outage lasted.
   - **Fingerprint before the Co-Ordinator runs, and record that value.**
     Anything that changed while it was working is something it may not have
     seen, so it must be allowed to bust the next cycle's fingerprint. A
     fingerprint taken afterwards would absorb that change and skip on it.
   - **The forced recheck is the safety valve, not a nicety.**
     `none_selected_recheck_hours` bounds how long a gap in coverage — or a
     Co-Ordinator that would have decided differently on a second look — can
     hold the pipeline down. At 24 h an idle day costs one Co-Ordinator run
     instead of 24, and any stall is capped at a day. Setting it to `0` makes
     fingerprint coverage load-bearing forever.
   - `--dry-run` and `--once` bypass the skip (a human asking for a cycle wants
     an answer, not a cached verdict) but still *compute and record* the
     fingerprint, so a `--once` that finds nothing spares the next cron tick
     the same question.
4. **Co-Ordinator stage.** Launch the Co-Ordinator (headless, model
   `coordinator_model`, `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, stage timeout),
   passing it the ordered repo list (each entry carrying its work sources and
   its pre-fetched `findings`) and the blocked-item extract from the shared
   log. Capture its final message with Claude Code's JSON output format and
   parse the work order from it.
5. If the work order is `{"selected": false}`, log `none-selected` with the
   Co-Ordinator's reason **and the fingerprint computed in requirement 3b**
   (omitted entirely, not stored empty, when the cycle was unfingerprintable —
   the next cycle must find no fingerprint rather than an empty one it could
   match against an equally empty sample of its own), release the lock, and
   exit. This event is the only thing that makes the next cycle cheap.
6. **Workspace.** Create `workspace_root/<cycle-id>/` and clone the selected
   repo into it, fresh from GitHub. This applies the multi-agent
   ways-of-working rule shared by all Poetic repositories: every agent works
   in its own dedicated fresh clone taken from the tip of the default branch
   before commencing any changes. (A full clone — stages may rebase onto a
   `default_branch` that has moved and need the merge base.) Agents only
   ever run inside this
   workspace; the Script must refuse (assert) to launch a stage whose
   working directory is outside `workspace_root`. The user's own clones
   under `~/Code` are never touched.
7. **Implementor stage.** Launch the Implementor in the clone (model from
   the work order, `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, stage timeout), passing
   the implementor prompt plus the work order.
8. **Reviewer stage.** If the Implementor reports `complete`, launch the
   Reviewer in the same workspace (model `reviewer_model`, same flags,
   stage timeout), passing the reviewer prompt, the work order, and the
   Implementor's summary (PR URL, branch).
9. **Failure handling.** If any stage times out, exits non-zero, or returns
   an unparseable summary: kill that stage's process group, log
   `attempt-failed` with enough detail for a future cycle to know the item
   is blocked and what would unblock it, and — if a draft PR was already
   opened — comment on it that the agent has abandoned it and why, leaving
   the PR and branch for the human to keep or discard. Because a stranded
   Implementor may never emit a parseable final message (and so never
   report its own `pr_url`), the Script also checks the clone for the
   `.git/agent-ops-pr-url` breadcrumb (requirement 23) before concluding no
   PR was ever opened. That breadcrumb lookup finding nothing is the *normal*
   case — no PR was opened — so it must not be an error: under `errexit` a
   non-zero there kills the cycle before it logs the very failure this
   requirement is about (see Gotchas).
9a. **A reported verdict is not a failure.** A stage that runs to completion
   and ends with `{"status": "blocked", …}` or `{"status": "void", …}`
   (requirement 27) has not failed: it has spent a full model run
   establishing something worth keeping. Record it against the selected item,
   carrying the stage's own words verbatim, rather than routing it through
   requirement 9's path (which would file it as "exited 0", discarding what it
   found) or, worse, dropping it. This is what stops the pipeline buying the
   same discovery every cycle for as long as the item exists.
9b. **`blocked` and `void` are different states and must not share one.**
   This is the requirement most likely to be read as pedantry and collapsed
   into "an item that can't proceed". Do not.
   - **`blocked`** — the work is real, something is in the way *for now* (an
     unmerged dependency, a red check, a decision nobody has taken). Record
     `attempt-failed` with the stage's `reason` and `unblock_condition`. The
     Co-Ordinator is expected to re-check these and clear them (`unblocked`)
     when the impediment lifts.
   - **`void`** — there is no work: the premise is false, almost always
     because the item is already done on `default_branch`. Record `item-void`
     with the stage's `reason` and `evidence`. **No agent may ever clear it**;
     only a human, by appending `unvoided` to the log by hand.
   The failure mode if you merge them is specific, silent, and was found in
   production rather than in review. An already-done recommendation is filed
   as `blocked`. The next Co-Ordinator, obeying its standing instruction to
   clear blockers that have gone away, checks the item, finds the work is
   done, correctly concludes that nothing is in its way, and logs `unblocked`.
   The item returns to the pool, is selected, is rediscovered as already done,
   and is filed again — indefinitely. Every component behaves exactly as
   specified. The bug is that one channel carried two meanings, so the
   evidence that should have shut the item forever (*the work is done*) was
   the very evidence that reopened it. If a state can be cleared by the same
   fact that ought to make it permanent, it is the wrong state.
10. **Usage-limit detection.** Whenever any `claude` invocation's transcript
    matches the shared pattern in `lib/limit-detect.sh` (`LIMIT_PHRASE_REGEX`
    — the generic `hit your .* limit` stem plus the legacy `usage limit` /
    `rate limit` / `usage cap` / `quota exceeded` terms; sourced by both the
    Script and `scripts/publish-dashboard.sh` so the two can't drift apart),
    write a `limit-hit` event with `resume_at`, `class`, and `needs_human`:
    - `resume_at` is parsed from an ISO-8601 timestamp in the message if
      present, else from a human-readable weekly reset clause (e.g. "resets
      Jul 17, 4am (Pacific/Auckland)" — the named zone is applied via `TZ`,
      not left in the string for `date -d`, and never combined with `date -u`
      in the same call, which would silently override the named zone), else
      a fallback: now + `limit_cooldown_default` for an ordinary/transient
      match, or now + a much longer cooldown (`LIMIT_LONG_COOLDOWN_HOURS`,
      ~1 day) when the phrasing says "weekly" or "monthly" and no reset time
      could be parsed at all — that fallback is too short for something that
      recurs on a multi-day cadence.
    - `class` is `weekly`, `monthly`, or `other`.
    - `needs_human` is true only when no reset time was parseable AND the
      phrasing says weekly/monthly (the spend-cap case: it clears only when a
      human raises the cap, or the billing month rolls over — auto-retry
      cannot fix it). A parsed reset time always means `needs_human: false`,
      since the pipeline can resume unattended once `resume_at` passes.

    There is no supported API for querying a subscription plan's remaining
    quota, so this fail-safe detection *is* the quota check, and
    back-pressure (2.2) is the primary spend control. Treat a parsed
    `resume_at` as an upper bound to stand down *until*, not a promise the
    block lasts that long — a cycle that succeeds before then simply clears
    the stand-down on its own.
11. **Cleanup.** Always: delete the cycle's workspace, write a `cycle-end`
    event, release the lock. Tee each stage's stdout/stderr to
    `state_dir/cycles/<cycle-id>/` for debugging.
12. **Flags.** `--dry-run` (run through step 5 then stop: prints the work
    order, launches no Implementor), `--once` (one verbose cycle in the
    foreground), `--repo <slug>` (restrict selection, for testing), plus the
    switch's `--disable [<reason>] [--for <duration>]`, `--enable` and
    `--status` (requirement 2.3), which manage the switch and run no cycle.
13. The Script must pass `shellcheck` and must set its own `PATH` explicitly
    (cron's environment is minimal), covering `claude`, `gh`, `git`, `jq`.
    When provisioning a host, prove that a cron-style invocation can resolve
    `claude` by running it from a minimal environment (for example with a
    sanitized `PATH` and `HOME`) before relying on scheduled runs.

### The Co-Ordinator (selection only)

14. Works read-only: `gh` reads (runs, issues, PRs, file contents via
    `gh api`) — it does not clone, and writes nothing but its final message.
    For the `security` and `code-quality` sources it does **not** re-query the
    Dependabot/code-scanning APIs itself; it reads the pre-fetched `findings`
    array the Script attached to each repo (requirement 3a), spending its
    `gh` budget only on the cheap claim/blocked checks below.
14a. **An issue is its whole thread, not just the opening post.** Whenever it
    evaluates or selects a GitHub issue, the Co-Ordinator reads the body *and
    every comment* — `gh issue view <n> --comments` (or `gh api
    repos/<slug>/issues/<n>/comments`). A bare `gh issue view <n>` or `gh api
    .../issues/<n>` returns only the body and silently drops the comments,
    where the parts that decide the work routinely live: added acceptance
    criteria, clarifications or corrections to the original ask, scope cuts, a
    "blocked"/"won't do" note, or a maintainer turning a discussion into an
    actionable task. A later comment that contradicts the body is the current
    instruction; the body alone is never taken as the whole ask.
15. Walks the repos in the order given. Within a repo, checks work sources
    in the configured priority order. For "failed Actions runs", a candidate
    exists only where the **most recent** run of a workflow on the default
    branch is a failure (a later green run supersedes older failures). The
    `security` source's candidates are the pre-fetched `findings` with
    `source: "security"` (Dependabot alerts and security-severity
    code-scanning alerts); the `code-quality` source's candidates are the
    `findings` with `source: "code-quality"`. The `project-review` source's
    candidates are the recommendations (`R-NN`) in the **most recent**
    `reviews/project-review-YYYY-MM-DD/` folder on the default branch: read
    that folder's `03-recommendations.md` and `04-improvement-prompts.md` via
    `gh api .../contents/...` (no pre-fetch — these are ordinary tracked files,
    like `TECH-DEBT.md`). A recommendation's stable ref is
    `review-<review-date>-R-NN`; the paired improvement prompt is the brief.
15b. **Review feedback comes second, across all repos.** Like security, this
    outranks the plain repo-then-source walk: any selectable `review_feedback`
    candidate in any repo is taken before any non-security work elsewhere. The
    human is this system's only consumer and its scarcest resource; when they
    have spent their time and asked for something specific, answering beats
    starting something new — and the work is already 90% done. The Co-Ordinator
    must **not** apply requirement 16's claim exclusion to this source: the open
    PR *is* the item, and excluding it makes every candidate permanently
    unselectable while looking entirely correct.
15a. **Security is always prioritised.** Beyond `security` being first in the
    source order, any candidate that is security-related — a `security`
    finding, a GitHub issue labelled `security`/`vulnerability`, a
    tech-debt entry flagged as a security concern, or a `project-review`
    recommendation whose text flags a security concern — outranks every
    non-security candidate across all repos and sources. If any selectable
    security candidate exists anywhere, the Co-Ordinator selects one of those
    before any non-security item, with the most severe first
    (`critical` > `high` > `medium` > `low`). Repo ordering (requirement 3)
    breaks ties among security candidates of equal severity.
16. Excludes from candidacy any item that is:
    - recorded as blocked in the shared log (an `attempt-failed` event not
      followed by an `unblocked` event for that item);
    - a tech-debt item whose Ledger row is `in-progress`;
    - already referenced by any open PR or draft (a claim, per the repos'
      claiming workflow), or already held by a live **claim branch** on the
      target repository (`td/<ID>` or `agent/<item-ref>` existing on origin —
      a peer node's claim that has not yet surfaced as a draft PR; the
      Script's own atomic claim in requirement 17a is the hard gate, this
      exclusion merely avoids proposing work that will lose the race) — for
      a `security`/`code-quality` finding, that means
      an open PR whose branch or body already references the same alert
      (`ref`, alert URL, or the affected package/rule); for a `project-review`
      recommendation, an open PR whose branch or body references its ref
      (`review-<date>-R-NN`);
    - a `project-review` recommendation that is already **done** — a *merged*
      PR references its ref (`review-<date>-R-NN`) — or that is already owned
      by a higher-priority source: the review mirrors debt-shaped
      recommendations into `TECH-DEBT.md` (or files them as issues)
      cross-referencing the `R-NN`, so a recommendation cross-referenced by a
      current tech-debt entry or open issue is left to that source and skipped
      here. (A single `gh` PR search per repo for the review date surfaces the
      open/merged/closed PRs referencing that review; match refs against it.)
      Note that a merged PR is a *floor*, not a proof: work that landed as a
      direct commit, or before the repo required PRs, leaves no PR to find and
      so reads as outstanding forever. The cross-reference is what covers that
      gap, which is why the review spec (`docs/REVIEW-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`, R12a)
      is required to write it and not merely expected to; requirement 9a is
      the backstop for when it is missing anyway — the item is then
      investigated once, and the finding remembered.
    - an issue that is assigned, labelled `blocked`, or is a question or
      discussion rather than actionable work — judged over the whole thread
      (requirement 14a), since a comment can block, close, re-scope, or answer
      an issue that its body alone would make look selectable;
    - a security finding whose only available fix is one a human must choose
      (e.g. a Dependabot alert with no non-breaking upgrade, needing a major
      version bump that changes the repo's public behaviour) — flag it, don't
      guess the upgrade;
    - dependent on a product or architecture decision that has not been
      made. (Example: poetic-fiddle's milestone M2 is gated on the §6.1
      packaging decision in its implementation plan — while that decision
      is open, M2 tasks do not meet the bar. Decisions belong to the human;
      never attempt to make one.)
17. From the remaining candidates, ranks the qualifying items best-first and
    returns up to `candidates_max` of them, each a stand-alone unit of work,
    clearly scoped, and adequately refined; the ranking preserves the
    priority walk, and the alternates exist because a peer node may win the
    claim on the first choice — not to lower the bar. Do not guess: if in
    doubt about an item, skip it. If nothing in the current category
    qualifies, fall through to the next category, then the next repo. Only
    after exhausting all repos does it return `{"selected": false}` with a
    one-line reason.
17a. **The claim.** The Script — never the model — takes an atomic per-item
    claim before the Implementor starts, walking the ranked candidates in
    order and handing the first successful claim onward (`lib/claim.sh`).
    The primitive is create-only, so GitHub arbitrates every race:
    - *Branch claims* (every source except `review-feedback`): a REST
      create-ref (`POST /git/refs`) on the target repository at the default
      branch's head. The claim branch **is** the working branch, derived
      deterministically so every node computes the same name for the same
      item: `td/<ID>` for tech-debt — the same lock the human claiming
      workflow in TECH-DEBT.md takes, so agents and humans contend safely —
      and `agent/<item-ref>` for everything else. A 422 (ref exists, even at
      the same SHA — which a plain `git push` of an identical ref would
      no-op) means a peer holds the item: log `claim-lost` and move to the
      next candidate.
    - *File claims* (`review-feedback`, which amends an existing PR and has
      no new branch to create): a create-only contents-API PUT (no `sha`) of
      `claims/<repo>/<ref>.json` in the state repository.
    - Every won claim also writes a best-effort **registry entry** at
      `claims/<repo>/<key>.json` in the state repository — the lock is the
      ref or file above; the registry is what back-pressure counts (2.2)
      and what gc sweeps — recording the base SHA, node, cycle, item and
      timestamp.
    - *Release*: an open PR supersedes the claim — the registry entry is
      dropped the moment `pr-raised` is logged, and the branch lives on as
      the PR's head. Every path that ends the cycle without a PR (a void
      verdict, a blocked verdict with no PR, a stage failure or timeout)
      releases fully; a claim branch is deleted **only** when it still
      points at the SHA the claim recorded and no open PR uses it — pushed
      work is never deleted. Entries older than `claim_ttl_hours` are swept
      by `lib/claim.sh gc` under the same only-if-untouched rule (a node
      that died mid-cycle must not hold its item forever).
    - Claims **fail closed** per candidate: any outcome other than a won
      claim (a lost race, or GitHub unreachable) moves to the next
      candidate, and a cycle whose every candidate is lost stands down with
      reason "every candidate is already claimed elsewhere". A node that
      cannot reach GitHub to claim could not have pushed the work either.
    - When `state_repo` is unset (a single-node operation), file claims are
      vacuously won and the registry is skipped; branch claims still work.
    - `--dry-run` claims nothing. `--once` claims exactly like an unattended
      cycle: a supervised run contends with the fleet on equal terms, which
      closes the race the lease never covered.
18. When it skips a blocked item, it may cheaply verify whether the recorded
    blocker still holds; if the blocker is demonstrably gone, it reports
    that in its final message so the Script can append an `unblocked` event,
    and may then treat the item as a candidate this same cycle. Two limits,
    both load-bearing (requirements 9b, 34c):
    - This applies to *impediments only*. Discovering that the item's work is
      already **done** is never grounds to unblock it — that is a void, and
      unblocking it hands it back to the pool to be rediscovered every cycle.
      Say so explicitly in the prompt, with the reasoning: an agent told to
      "clear blockers that no longer apply" will otherwise conclude, correctly
      and disastrously, that an already-done item has no blocker.
    - It may **never** clear a void item, and is given no field with which to
      try. It may *create* one for a candidate it can see conclusively is
      already done, which saves an entire Implementor run.
19. Chooses the Implementor's model: `implementor_model_trivial` only when
    the item can be completed without changing any file that affects runtime
    behaviour (docs, comments, register entries); otherwise
    `implementor_model_default`. Records the reasoning.
20. Emits its entire final message as one JSON object: `selected`,
    `unblocked`, `voided`, and a ranked `candidates` array of up to
    `candidates_max` work orders (the Script accepts the former
    single-selection shape — the work-order fields at the top level — for
    one release, treating it as a one-candidate list). Candidates carry no
    `branch`: the Script derives and injects the claim branch (requirement
    17a), except for `review-feedback`, whose `branch` is the PR's existing
    branch carried from the entry. For a `failed-runs` entry, `item` is
    `failed-run-` plus the workflow file's basename without extension —
    deterministic, so every node derives the same claim key. `source` is one of
    `security`, `review-feedback`, `failed-runs`, `tech-debt`, `issues`,
    `implementation-plan`, `project-review`, or `code-quality`. For a
    `review-feedback` entry, `item` is its `ref`, `branch` is the PR's
    **existing** branch, the order also carries `pr_url` and `pr_number`, and
    `context` must paste the entry's `body` **verbatim** — it is a human's
    specific, considered request and it is the entire brief. A model
    summarising a review before handing it to the model that must act on it is
    a lossy telephone game about what a person actually asked for. For a `security`/`code-quality`
    finding, `item` is the finding's stable `ref` (e.g. `dependabot-alert-42`,
    `code-scanning-alert-17`) and `context` must paste the finding verbatim
    (package/rule, severity, affected location, advisory summary, and the
    alert URL) so the Implementor can act without re-querying the API. For a
    `project-review` recommendation, `item` is its ref
    (`review-<review-date>-R-NN`) and `context` must paste the recommendation's
    improvement prompt (from `04-improvement-prompts.md`) verbatim, together
    with the review folder path and the `R-NN` detail; `acceptance` is the
    recommendation's *Intended end state*. For an `issues` entry, `item` is the
    issue number and `context` must paste the issue body **and every comment**
    verbatim (each attributed to its author, in order) — not the opening post
    alone. The Implementor starts with nothing but this work order, so a
    clarification or acceptance criterion left in a comment is lost unless the
    Co-Ordinator carries it across; where the comments changed the ask,
    `acceptance` is set from the current state of the thread, not the original
    body.

    }
    ```

### The Implementor

21. Operates as a single non-interactive `claude -p` invocation with no
    resumption: once it emits a final message with no further tool calls,
    the process exits for good — nothing wakes it later. It must wait for
    long-running commands (dependency installs, builds, test suites)
    synchronously, in the foreground or by polling within the same session,
    rather than ending its turn expecting an external notification when
    they finish. A command too slow to wait out within the stage timeout is
    grounds for `"status": "blocked"`, not an early, hopeful end of turn.
22. Runs inside the cycle's clone. First reads the repo's `CLAUDE.md` and
    obeys it throughout. Checks out the branch named in the work order —
    already created on origin by the Script as the item's claim (requirement
    17a) — and never creates, renames, or deletes a branch of its own.
23. **Makes the claim visible before implementing.** The branch is the
    lock, but humans read PRs, not refs: opens a draft PR immediately, labelled
    `pr_label`, with a Conventional-Commits title (it will become the squash
    commit on `main`) and a body giving the item reference and planned
    approach. Immediately records the PR's URL at `.git/agent-ops-pr-url` in
    the clone — `.git/` is never part of the tracked tree, so this can't
    leak into a commit — so the Script can still identify the PR even if
    this stage never reaches a parseable final message (requirement 9). For
    tech-debt items this follows the repo's claiming workflow exactly
    (Ledger flip to `in-progress` as the first commit). For issues, it
    comments on the issue linking the draft PR; the work order's `context`
    already carries the issue body and its comments (requirement 20), but if
    the Implementor consults the issue directly it reads the whole thread
    (`gh issue view <n> --comments`), never a bare `gh issue view <n>` that
    hides the comments where corrected requirements usually live. For `security`/`code-quality`
    findings, the draft PR body names the alert (its `ref` and URL) so the
    claim is visible to any other cycle scanning open PRs. For a
    `project-review` recommendation, the draft PR body names the ref
    (`review-<date>-R-NN`) and links the review folder and recommendation, so
    the claim (and, once merged, the completion) is visible to any other cycle
    scanning PRs — there is no ledger and the review folder is not modified.
24. Implements the item, then runs the same checks the repo's CI runs (as
    documented in that repo's `CLAUDE.md` and workflow files) and fixes
    anything they surface.
25. Updates the originating record: tech-debt entry removed and Ledger row
    flipped to `resolved` per the register's rules; issues linked with a
    closing keyword in the PR body; implementation-plan task marked done.
    For `security`/`code-quality` findings, no ledger flip applies — GitHub
    closes a Dependabot or code-scanning alert automatically once the fix
    lands on the default branch and is re-scanned — so the PR body names the
    alert it resolves (and its URL); the Implementor never dismisses an alert
    itself (dismissal is a human decision). For a `project-review`
    recommendation, there is likewise no ledger to flip and the review folder
    (a point-in-time record) is left untouched — the PR body names the ref
    (`review-<date>-R-NN`) so its eventual merge marks the recommendation done;
    a later review re-evaluates the code and simply omits anything now fixed.
    Adds a `CHANGELOG.md` entry when the change is notable by that repo's
    definition (a security fix usually is).
26. Verifies the PR via `gh pr view --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus`
    (against GitHub's view, not inferred locally) and resolves any conflict
    with the current default branch. Leaves the PR as a **draft** — the
    Reviewer flips it to ready.
27. Ends with a single JSON object as its entire final message:
    `{"status": "complete", "pr_url": …, "branch": …, "notes": …}`,
    `{"status": "blocked", "reason": …, "unblock_condition": …}`, or
    `{"status": "void", "reason": …, "evidence": …}`. The Implementor is the
    only component positioned to tell `blocked` from `void` (requirement 9b) —
    it is the one that actually reads the tree — so its prompt must draw the
    distinction explicitly and demand evidence for `void`. Do not leave it to
    infer that "already done" is a kind of blocker; it reads that way, and the
    two states behave in opposite ways downstream.

### The Reviewer

28. Operates under the same one-shot constraint as the Implementor
    (requirement 21): no resumption, no background notification. It waits
    for slow commands — installs, builds, `gh pr checks --watch` — in the
    foreground within the same session rather than ending its turn early.
29. Reviews the PR against the work order's item and acceptance notes, and
    against the target repo's own standards and conventions; re-runs the
    repo's checks.
30. Where it finds a problem it can fix with confidence, it fixes it
    directly on the branch — committing, rebasing onto the current default
    branch, or force-pushing as it judges best (permitted only on
    `branch_prefix` branches, per "The Human Gate"). Where it cannot fix
    with confidence, it leaves a PR review comment describing the problem
    for the Human Reviewer.
31. Confirms CI is passing (`gh pr checks`) and the PR is mergeable, then
    marks it ready for review (`gh pr ready`). It never approves and never
    merges.
32. Ends with a single JSON object:
    `{"status": "ready" | "needs-human", "pr_url": …, "fixes_applied": […], "comments_left": n, "ci": "passing" | …}`.

### Logging and state

33. The shared log is a single JSON Lines file, `state_dir/log.jsonl`,
    appended only by the Script (agents report via their final messages; the
    Script translates those into log events). The lock in requirement 1
    guarantees a single writer. Events: `cycle-start`, `cycle-skipped`,
    `stand-down`, `selection`, `claim-lost`, `none-selected`, `stage-start`,
    `stage-end`, `pr-raised`, `pr-ready`, `attempt-failed`, `unblocked`,
    `item-void`, `unvoided`, `limit-hit`, `disabled`, `enabled`, `warning`,
    `cycle-end`. A `claim-lost` names the repo, item and branch a peer node
    won (requirement 17a); `selection` carries the claimed `branch`.
    Common fields: ISO-8601 `ts`, `cycle` id, `node`, `event`, and where
    applicable `repo`, `item`, `pr_url`, `model`, `detail`. The cycle id is
    `<UTC-timestamp>-<node>-<pid>` — the node's `NODE_NAME` (hostname when
    unset), sanitised for use in a directory name, with the pid always last
    because the dashboard matches the running cycle by its `-<pid>` suffix.
    `node` says which machine wrote the record, which is what lets several
    nodes' records be combined; records written before the field existed
    simply lack it, and every reader treats it as optional. A `none-selected` also carries
    the `fingerprint` of requirement 3b; `disabled`/`enabled` carry the switch
    record, so the log can explain both why cycles stopped and why they
    resumed — including when they resumed because a disable expired rather than
    because anyone chose to re-enable it. `selection`, and any `attempt-failed` or `item-void`
    raised once an item has been selected, must carry both `repo` and `item` —
    requirements 34 and 34c key on them, so an event that omits them cannot
    pin any state on the item it names, and the omission is invisible until you
    notice the same work being redone.
34. Blocked semantics: an item is blocked iff the most recent
    `attempt-failed` / `unblocked` event *for that item* is `attempt-failed`.
    An `attempt-failed` event must carry enough detail for a future
    Co-Ordinator to judge whether the blocker has since been removed.
    `unblocked` events may also be appended by hand by the human. Three
    details decide whether this rule works at all:
    - **Key on `repo` and `item` together.** An item id is only unique within
      its repo — every repo has a `dependabot-alert-1`, and registers that
      number by date collide across repos — so keying on the id alone lets one
      repo's block starve the other's identically-named work.
    - **An event carrying no `item` blocks nothing**, and must be dropped
      rather than grouped under an empty key: a stage that fails before
      anything is selected has no item to blame, and collapsing every such
      event together yields one "blocked" entry describing no item at all.
    - **An `unblocked` event naming no repo clears that item in every repo.**
      The Co-Ordinator reports unblocked as a bare id (requirement 18) and a
      human appending one by hand has no repo to hand either, so there is
      nothing to match on. Over-clearing is the safe direction: the item
      merely becomes a candidate again and re-blocks on its next attempt.
34a. Whatever computes requirement 34 must be the **only** definition of it.
    Anything else that reports blocked items — notably the monitoring
    dashboard (`docs/DASHBOARD-SPEC.md`) — shares that one
    implementation rather than reimplementing the rule. Two copies drift, and
    a dashboard that quietly disagrees with the Co-Ordinator about what is
    blocked is worse than no dashboard: it is where you would look to find
    this class of bug, and it would show you the wrong answer confidently.
34c. Void semantics: an item is void iff the most recent `item-void` /
    `unvoided` event *for that item* is `item-void`. The rule is requirement
    34's shape over a different pair of events, and all three of its details
    apply unchanged — key on `repo`+`item`, an event naming no item voids
    nothing, a clear naming no repo clears everywhere. Build it as one
    parameterised rule used twice, not two rules that happen to agree
    (requirement 34a).
    - An `item-void` event carries `reason` and `evidence` — the SHAs, paths,
      or commands proving there is no work. A void is terminal, so the record
      must let a human audit the verdict without redoing the investigation.
    - **Only a human may clear a void**, by appending `unvoided` by hand. Give
      the Co-Ordinator no way to emit one; the whole point is that it must not
      reason its way out of a void, and it can reason its way out of anything.
    - A void is keyed to a specific item id, which is what stops it becoming a
      permanent gag. When the review pipeline runs again it files its
      recommendations under fresh ids (`review-<new-date>-R-NN`) that no
      existing void covers, so a genuine regression returns as new work. Voids
      expire by irrelevance rather than by review, which is the only expiry an
      unattended system will actually perform.
    - The Co-Ordinator may *create* voids (requirement 18) for candidates it
      can see conclusively are already done, and should: that is one cheap read
      instead of a full Implementor run reaching the same answer. Creating is
      safe where clearing is not — a wrong void costs a human one line in a
      log, a wrong unvoid costs a cycle every hour until someone notices.

## Components

What exists, and the requirements each part answers to:

1. `config.json` with the values above.
2. `agent-cycle.sh` implementing requirements 1–13 (including the findings
   pre-fetch, requirement 3a; the switch, requirement 2.3; the role guard,
   requirement 2.4; and the no-op short-circuit, requirement 3b).
3. `scripts/gather-findings.sh` implementing requirement 3a: given a repo
   slug, prints a normalised JSON array of the repo's open Dependabot and
   code-scanning alerts, degrading to `[]` (exit 0) when a feature is
   disabled or inaccessible. Must pass `shellcheck`.
3c. `scripts/gather-review-feedback.sh` implementing requirement 3c: given a
   repo slug, PR label and branch prefix, prints the JSON array of PRs awaiting
   our reply to a human's review, each carrying every review body and inline
   comment in the round verbatim. Fails safe to `[]` (exit 0). Must pass
   `shellcheck`.
3b. `scripts/gather-source-state.sh` implementing requirement 3b's sampling:
   given a repo slug and default branch, prints one JSON object holding that
   repo's head SHA and its issues, workflows and open-PR digests, with `ok:
   false` if any of it could not be fetched cleanly. Never exits non-zero — a
   cost-control feature must not become a reliability risk — but must not
   pretend a failed call is an empty result either (see requirement 3b). Must
   pass `shellcheck`.
3d. `scripts/state-sync.sh` implementing requirement 2.5: `push`, `restore` and
   `lease`. Called by both pipelines (the lease before any work, the push from
   the cleanup that ends a cycle) and by the container crontab (the restore).
   Every mode is a no-op when `state_repo` is unset. Needs `rsync` and `git`,
   and degrades to a warning and exit 0 when either is missing, because a node
   that cannot replicate is still a node that can run. Unit-tested against a
   local bare repository and a stubbed `gh` (`test/state-sync.test.sh`); must
   pass `shellcheck`.
3e. `lib/claim.sh` implementing requirement 17a: `claim` (kinds `branch` and
   `file`), `release`, `count` and `gc`, exit codes 0 won/done, 3 lost, 1
   error. Called by `agent-cycle.sh` (the claim loop after selection, the
   release hooks on every no-PR ending, the `count` inside back-pressure).
   `CLAIM_GH` substitutes a stub for tests, following `STATE_SYNC_GH`.
   Unit-tested with concurrent-claim races against a filesystem-CAS stub
   (`test/claim.test.sh`); must pass `shellcheck`.
3a. The shared library (`lib/cycle-state.sh`, `lib/limit-detect.sh`,
   `lib/toggle.sh`, `lib/noop-skip.sh` and `lib/role.sh`) holding every rule
   that more than one component computes — at minimum requirement 34's blocked
   semantics, requirement 33's `attempt-failed` field shape, the usage-limit
   phrase pattern of requirement 10, the switch of requirement 2.3 (read by
   both pipelines and the dashboard), the role guard of requirement 2.4 (read
   by both pipelines) and the fingerprint rule of requirement 3b —
   sourced by `agent-cycle.sh`, `review-cycle.sh` and the dashboard's publisher
   rather than copied into any of them. Unit-tested directly (`test/*.test.sh`, plain bash assertions, no
   framework) and `shellcheck`-clean. These rules are the system's memory of
   what it has already tried; a second copy of one is a bug with a delay
   fuse, and both copies read correctly right up until they disagree.
4. `prompts/coordinator.md`, `prompts/implementor.md`, `prompts/reviewer.md`
   implementing requirements 14–20, 21–27, and 28–32 respectively. Each
   prompt must embed the relevant shared-repo conventions from this document
   so a stage never depends on context it wasn't given.
5. `README.md`: what the system does, every config key, install steps
   (below), how to operate it (`--dry-run`, `--once`, reading the log and
   stage transcripts), and how to uninstall. It presents the container as the
   way a node runs and points at the runbook for the detail; the host install
   and the WSL SysV dashboard service remain documented as the laptop's legacy
   path, which must keep working until it is cut over.
6. The crontab line, e.g.
   `0 * * * * $HOME/Code/Poetic-Poems/agent-ops/agent-cycle.sh >> $HOME/.local/state/poetic-agents/cron.log 2>&1`,
   with `AGENT_OPS_ROLE=active` set in the crontab's environment on the node
   that is to run the cycles (requirement 2.4).
7. `deploy/docker/` — the node image and the node stack (see "The node image"
   and "The node stack" above): `Dockerfile`, `entrypoint.sh`, `crontab` and the
   minimal `claude-settings.json` seed; `compose.yaml`, `ts-serve.json` and
   `.env.example`; and the node runbook `deploy/docker/README.md` with the
   unattended `cloud-init.yaml` that performs its first three steps. The
   runbook is the operator-facing counterpart to those two sections: bring-up,
   everyday commands, updating, changing a node's role, the failover drill and
   a symptom-to-cause table. The container crontab is the schedule component 6 describes,
   expressed for a node; both exist because the laptop still runs the host-cron
   path.
8. `deploy/agent-ops-dashboard.init` and `deploy/tailscaled.init` — the legacy
   WSL SysV path for the laptop, superseded on a containerised node.
9. `.github/workflows/build-image.yml` — the build-and-publish path for
   component 7's image: build, verify the toolchain, validate the crontab, run
   the `test/` suite inside the image, and check the role guard; then publish
   to GHCR on `main` only. It carries `packages: write` and authenticates as
   the workflow's own `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so nothing about publishing depends on a
   human's credentials.

## Acceptance checks

Every change to the system must leave all of these passing; before opening a
pull request, run the ones the change touches and any it could regress.

1. `shellcheck agent-cycle.sh scripts/*.sh lib/*.sh` is clean.
1a. **The role guard holds in both directions.** `test/role.test.sh` passes:
   every value that is not `active` stands the node down with a cron-log line,
   exit 0 and nothing written under `state_dir`; `--dry-run`, `--once` and the
   switch commands run regardless of the role.
1b. **The image builds and carries the whole toolchain.**
   `docker build -f deploy/docker/Dockerfile -t agent-ops .` succeeds, and
   inside it, as user `agent`: `bash`, `git`, `jq`, `curl`, `python3`, `perl`,
   `flock`, `sha256sum`, `rsync`, `node`, `claude`, `gh` (≥ 2.60) and
   `supercronic` all resolve; `supercronic -test /app/deploy/docker/crontab`
   reports the crontab valid; the `test/` suite passes inside the container;
   and `/app/agent-cycle.sh` with no role set exits 0 through the requirement
   2.4 guard. `.github/workflows/build-image.yml` runs every one of these on
   every pull request, so a change that breaks the image cannot be merged —
   and it is the only place the `test/` suite runs in CI.
1c. **The stack comes up from nothing and is idempotent.** With a `.env` copied
   from `.env.example` and `COMPOSE_PROFILES=local`, `docker compose up -d` in
   `deploy/docker/` starts `scheduler` and `dashboard-local` on fresh volumes;
   `curl http://127.0.0.1:$DASHBOARD_PORT/` and `/data.js` return 200; the
   scheduler's log shows supercronic reading the crontab and the 5-minute
   heartbeat firing; `agent-cycle.sh` and `review-cycle.sh` stand the node down
   through the requirement 2.4 guard with `ROLE=standby`; and a second
   `up -d` reports every container `Running` without recreating one.
   `docker compose --profile tailnet config` is valid.
1d. **State replicates, and only one node runs.** `test/state-sync.test.sh`
   passes: a push carries the logs, cycles, reviews and switch but not the
   locks, the dashboard or the lease; an unchanged push does not force-push; a
   changed one amends rather than accumulating history; the mirror keeps
   `cycles_retained` cycles while the node's own `cycles/` and `reviews/` are
   pruned to the newest `state_local_cycles_retained` by the same push, a
   no-change push included, newest always kept; a restore is a mirror
   that leaves the node's local-only files alone, and is a silent no-op on the
   active node and when nothing changed; a fresh foreign lease stands a cycle
   down with a logged stand-down and no selection, while an expired one is
   taken over.
2. `--dry-run` completes against the real repos: stand-down checks pass,
   ordering is computed, the findings pre-fetch runs, the Co-Ordinator selects
   an item or declines with a reason, the work order is printed, nothing
   further launches, and the log records the cycle.
2a. `scripts/gather-findings.sh Poetic-Poems/poetic` prints a valid JSON
   array (possibly empty), and prints `[]` and exits 0 for a repo with the
   features disabled — never a non-zero exit that would abort the cycle.
3. A second invocation while one holds the lock exits without acting.
4. A simulated stale lock (fake lock file, old timestamp, dead PID) is taken
   over with a logged warning.
5. An injected `limit-hit` event with a future `resume_at` causes a
   stand-down; an expired one does not.
6. With `max_open_agent_prs` temporarily set to 0, the Script stands down on
   back-pressure.
6a. **The switch stops both pipelines and lets go by itself.**
   `--disable 'testing'` then a plain invocation of *both* `agent-cycle.sh` and
   `review-cycle.sh`: each logs a stand-down carrying the reason, exits 0, and
   launches no `claude`. `--enable` restores both. Then plant a record whose
   `expires_at` is already past and run a cycle: it must clear the switch, log
   `enabled` saying the disable expired, and proceed — the assertion that an
   agent which sets the switch and dies costs a few cycles rather than every
   future one. Assert the ambiguous cases resolve toward *disabled*: a
   truncated record, and one whose `expires_at` is gibberish, both keep the
   pipeline down.
6c. **A review round is answered exactly once.** With a PR carrying an
   unanswered `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, a cycle must select it (`source:
   "review-feedback"`, `item` the round's ref, `branch` the PR's existing
   branch) and the Implementor must push to that branch without opening
   anything. Then the check that matters: run another cycle and assert the PR
   is **no longer a candidate**, while `gh pr view --json reviewDecision` still
   reports `CHANGES_REQUESTED`. Those two facts are true simultaneously, and
   that is the point — the agent cannot clear a review on its own PR, so
   nothing about the PR's state ever says "answered", and only the turn rule
   (latest review vs head commit) distinguishes "our move" from "theirs". Get
   it wrong and the PR is re-fixed hourly forever while every cycle looks
   productive. Assert the reopen too: a *new* review after the agent's push
   makes it a candidate again under a *new* ref, or a round that once went
   `blocked` will swallow the human's next attempt to unstick it.
6d. **Back-pressure cannot deadlock the pipeline (requirement 2.2a).** Set
   `max_open_agent_prs` to 0 with a review-feedback candidate present: the
   cycle must **not** stand down, and must reach the Co-Ordinator with every
   repo's `sources` narrowed to `["review-feedback"]`. With no candidate
   present it must stand down as before. This is the check that a system whose
   PRs have all been sent back for changes can still dig itself out; without
   it, the state the pipeline is least able to escape is the one it is
   guaranteed to reach.
6b. **The no-op short-circuit skips only what it can prove, and stops skipping
   when anything moves.** Drive a cycle that ends `none-selected`, confirm the
   event carries a fingerprint, then run a second cycle: it must stand down
   *without launching the Co-Ordinator* — that saving is the entire feature, so
   time both and see it. Then the half that actually matters, and the half
   it is tempting to skip because the happy path passed: assert
   per-source that the fingerprint *changes* when a commit lands, an issue is
   relabelled or assigned, a workflow's conclusion flips, a claiming PR closes,
   an item is unblocked or unvoided, a source is added to `config.json`, or
   `prompts/coordinator.md` is edited. Each of those is a source of work, and
   any one of them missing from the fingerprint is an unbounded silent stall
   that no other check in this document would catch. Assert too that a
   scheduled workflow rerunning green does *not* change it (see requirement 3b
   — this is where the feature quietly dies), and that a repo whose state could
   not be sampled makes the cycle unfingerprintable rather than skippable.
7. **A blocked verdict round-trips.** Append an `attempt-failed` for a
   selected item, then run a cycle: the Co-Ordinator's input must list that
   item as blocked, with its detail. This is the one check that catches the
   writer and the reader disagreeing about the event key (requirements 33/34)
   — nothing else in the system will tell you they disagree, because both
   halves look correct in isolation and the only symptom is work being
   silently redone.
8. **A no-op Implementor is recorded.** Drive one cycle in which the
   Implementor reports `blocked` without opening a PR: the cycle must exit 0
   having logged an `attempt-failed` carrying that item and the stage's own
   reason — not die part-way, and not log nothing. Under `errexit` this is
   where a helper returning "not found" as a non-zero status silently kills
   the run (requirement 9).
8a. **A void survives an agent trying to clear it.** Append an `item-void` for
   an item, then an `unblocked` for the same item, then run a cycle: the item
   must still be void and absent from the Co-Ordinator's candidates. This is
   the check that would have caught requirement 9b being collapsed into one
   state, and it fails loudly on a system that looks entirely healthy — the
   log fills with confident, correct-looking events and the same item is
   worked forever. Assert the negative too: `unvoided` *does* clear it, or you
   have built a state no human can escape.
8b. **The two states are visible apart.** A human looking at the monitor can
   tell "waiting on something" from "there is nothing to do here" without
   reading the log. If both render as one list, the operator cannot tell an
   item needing their help from one needing nothing, which is how a stuck
   pipeline and a healthy one come to look identical.
9. A cron-style invocation from a minimal environment can resolve `claude`
   and run `claude -V` (or a tiny `claude -p` smoke test) successfully.
10. One supervised full cycle (`--once`) against whichever repo the ordering
    picks: it produces a labelled, mergeable, ready-for-review PR with the
    originating register updated and a complete log trail. Report the PR URL
    to the human rather than merging anything.

## Host provisioning (human steps)

All of this is in place on the current host; it is needed again only when
standing the system up on a new machine.

1. Install the standalone CLI: `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`
   (or `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`). Verify headless auth
   works: `claude -p "Reply with OK" --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`.
   Then prove that cron can invoke Claude by running it in a minimal
   environment with the same PATH shape cron will use, e.g.
   `env -i HOME="$HOME" PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/.claude/local:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin" /bin/bash -lc 'command -v claude && claude -V'`.
   If `command -v claude` fails, create a launcher in `~/.local/bin` or add
   the correct PATH to the crontab before continuing.
2. Enable cron in WSL: add to `/etc/wsl.conf`
   `[boot]` / `command = "service cron start"` (requires sudo), then restart
   WSL (`wsl --shutdown` from Windows). Alternative if preferred: a Windows
   Task Scheduler job running
   `wsl.exe -u wallen -e $HOME/Code/Poetic-Poems/agent-ops/agent-cycle.sh` hourly.
   Either way, cycles only run while the machine is awake — a missed cycle
   simply waits for the next tick, which is harmless.
3. Create the label in both repos:
   `gh api -X POST repos/Poetic-Poems/<repo>/labels -f name='autonomous-agent' -f color='ededed' -f description='PR raised by the autonomous agent system'`.
   If your `gh` version already supports `gh label create`, that form also works; the API form above is the most compatible fallback.
3a. Enable the security work sources on both repos so the alerts the
   `security`/`code-quality` sources read actually exist: turn on the
   Dependabot alerts and code-scanning (CodeQL) features (Settings → Code
   security, or the equivalent org policy — free for public repos; requires
   GitHub Advanced Security for private ones). The `gh` token must be able to
   read `repos/<slug>/dependabot/alerts` and
   `repos/<slug>/code-scanning/alerts` (the `security_events` scope, or
   `repo` on a classic token). If a feature stays off, `gather-findings.sh`
   simply returns no findings for it and the rest of the pipeline is
   unaffected.
4. Create `Poetic-Poems/agent-ops` and clone it to
   `~/Code/Poetic-Poems/agent-ops`.
5. After the acceptance checks pass, install the crontab line.

## Cost profile

A worst-case cycle is one small Haiku selection pass, one Sonnet
implementation (the dominant cost), and one Sonnet review. Stand-down cycles
cost nothing but a few `gh` calls. Because back-pressure caps open agent PRs
at `max_open_agent_prs`, sustained spend is bounded by the rate at which the
human merges — the system cannot run ahead of its only consumer.

The floor matters as much as the ceiling, because it is paid on every quiet
day and nothing about it looks like waste. Before requirement 3b, an idle
repository still bought 24 full Co-Ordinator passes a day, each one reading
both repos and concluding, correctly and expensively, that there was nothing to
do (measured: ~2m35s of Haiku per pass against these repos). The no-op
short-circuit replaces those with a handful of `gh` calls and a hash, leaving
one forced pass a day (`none_selected_recheck_hours`) as the safety valve —
roughly a 96% cut in the idle floor, and no change at all to a busy day, where
every cycle has something to fingerprint that moved.

## Design decisions

Recorded so a future reader knows they were deliberate, not accidental.
History and superseded approaches belong here (and in Gotchas), never in the
requirements above, which state only what is.

- **The Script orchestrates every launch; the Co-Ordinator only selects.**
  Per-stage timeouts, clean kills, and restartability come free from the
  process model, and the cheap Co-Ordinator session is not held open while
  an implementation runs for an hour.
- **Agents work in ephemeral clones**, never in the user's working copies
  under `~/Code`, which the user may be editing at any moment. This is the
  multi-agent ways-of-working rule shared by all Poetic repositories: every
  agent — autonomous or interactive — makes its own dedicated clone from the
  default branch before commencing any changes, and never assumes the default
  branch still matches what it cloned when it opens the pull request.
- **Draft-PR claiming is fused with the review flow**: the Implementor's
  draft PR is simultaneously the repos' standard claim marker and the
  Reviewer's input; the Reviewer flipping it to ready is the hand-off to the
  human gate.
- **Back-pressure on open agent PRs replaces a quota-balance check** as the
  primary throttle, because no supported API exposes a subscription plan's
  remaining quota; usage-limit errors are handled fail-safe via detection
  and cooldown (requirement 10).
- **The 6-hour stale rule became a 3-hour lock plus per-stage timeouts** —
  finer-grained, and a wedged stage can no longer consume six hours of
  quota.
- **Work-source categories are mapped to what actually exists** in the two
  repos (security findings, failed runs, tech-debt registers, GitHub issues,
  fiddle's implementation plan, project-review recommendations, and
  code-quality findings). User stories and road maps were dropped — neither
  repo has them; the config structure accepts new sources when they appear.
- **The weekly project review feeds the pipeline as a work source.** The
  review pipeline (`docs/REVIEW-PIPELINE-SPEC.md`) lands, in each repo, both an
  updated `TECH-DEBT.md` (the primary, status-tracked channel — picked up by
  the `tech-debt` source) and a `reviews/project-review-*/` folder of
  prioritised recommendations with ready-to-run improvement prompts. The
  `project-review` source consumes the latter so that recommendations *not*
  also filed as tech-debt or an issue are still actioned rather than left to
  rot in a folder. It sits just above `code-quality` (a human-approved
  recommendation beats an automated one) and below the curated channels, and
  dedups against them via the `R-NN` cross-reference the review writes into
  each mirrored tech-debt entry (required of the review by R12a of
  `docs/REVIEW-PIPELINE-SPEC.md` — for a long time this bullet merely *assumed*
  it, which is why the dedup silently didn't work; see Gotchas). Because the recommendations file is
  regenerated each week (its `R-NN` IDs are per-review, so a ref is
  review-dated), an un-actioned recommendation is simply re-offered under a new
  ref by the next review; persistent items live in `TECH-DEBT.md`, which has
  stable IDs — so the regeneration doesn't strand work. Done-ness is tracked by
  the PR referencing the ref (open = claimed, merged = done), the same
  PR-as-source-of-truth pattern the findings sources use, so the review folder
  stays an immutable point-in-time record.
- **Security findings are a first-class, always-first work source.** GitHub's
  own Dependabot and code-scanning alerts are treated as work items, and any
  security-related candidate outranks all non-security work (requirement 15a),
  even a red `main` — a known, exploitable vulnerability is the highest-stakes
  thing the pipeline can be pointed at. Non-security code-scanning findings
  become the lowest-priority `code-quality` source: real, but more speculative
  and higher-volume than curated tech-debt or filed issues, so they never
  crowd out deliberate work.
- **Findings are pre-fetched by the Script, not the model** (requirement 3a,
  `scripts/gather-findings.sh`). The Dependabot and code-scanning APIs are
  paginated and verbose; digesting them in the cheap Co-Ordinator session
  would burn tokens on plumbing. A deterministic bash+`gh`+`jq` script
  normalises them into compact findings the Co-Ordinator reads directly — the
  same pattern already used to feed it the ordered repo list and blocked
  extract. It fails safe to `[]` so a repo without the feature (or without
  token scope) costs nothing and breaks nothing.
- **Tech-debt handling uses the repos' own claiming workflow directly**
  (both repos have identical `TECH-DEBT.md` machinery and a `/td` skill;
  the Implementor follows the documented workflow rather than dispatching
  through the skill, which exists to launch agents — the Implementor
  already is one).
- **The Co-Ordinator falls through** to the next category or repo when
  candidates fail the suitability bar, instead of giving up after the first
  category that yielded any candidate.
- **Branch names drop the repo slug** (`agent/<item-slug>`): a branch is
  already scoped to its repository.
- **Review feedback is a work source, and the human's turn is a timestamp
  comparison** (requirement 3c). Before it, an agent PR that received "changes
  requested" was a dead end: the open PR claimed its own item (requirement
  16.3), no source read `reviewDecision`, and only a human could break the
  deadlock — by fixing it themselves or closing the PR and losing the work. The
  system could raise PRs but never answer the one person it raises them for.

  The mechanism turns on a constraint that looks like an obstacle and is
  actually the design: GitHub will not let a PR's author approve or dismiss a
  review on it, and this system is the author. So the agent *cannot* clear
  `CHANGES_REQUESTED` — which both preserves the human gate for free (there is
  no route by which an agent marks its own work accepted) and means the PR's
  own state can never tell us the feedback was answered. Whose turn it is has
  to be derived, and the derivation is one comparison: latest review vs head
  commit. That single clause is the difference between a source that converges
  and one that re-fixes the same PR every hour forever while looking productive.
- **The switch is one shared, expiring file** (requirement 2.3). Shared because
  the hazard is an agent editing the agent-ops tree, and *both* pipelines run
  out of that tree and source the same `lib/` — a per-pipeline switch would let
  the weekly review fire into a half-written `lib/limit-detect.sh`. Expiring
  because the switch is the only thing in this system whose deliberate purpose
  is a total, silent stop, which makes a forgotten one indistinguishable from a
  quiet week; `disable_default_ttl` bounds that at a few cycles, and `forever`
  remains available for a maintenance window someone actually means. In
  `state_dir` rather than the repo, because the repo is the thing being edited:
  a tracked switch would arrive and depart with branch checkouts and could be
  committed by accident. `agent-cycle.sh` is the only writer, so there is one
  record and one implementation to keep honest.
- **The no-op short-circuit fingerprints the Co-Ordinator's inputs rather than
  its answer** (requirement 3b). The alternative framings are all worse: caching
  the verdict for N hours is arbitrary and stale; asking a cheaper model whether
  anything changed reintroduces the token cost being avoided; and letting the
  Co-Ordinator decide when to skip asks the component being skipped to opt out.
  Hashing the inputs makes the skip a deterministic claim about bytes, which is
  a claim bash can make correctly and a test can pin — and it composes with the
  existing pre-fetch design, since the two most expensive inputs (`findings`,
  the blocked/void extracts) were already computed in the Script. It also fails
  in the right direction by construction: anything unexpected — a changed
  digest shape, a failed sample, a log the rule can't read — produces "no
  match", which costs one Co-Ordinator run. The rule can only be wrong by being
  *incomplete*, which is why requirement 3b's map of source-to-signal is
  normative and `none_selected_recheck_hours` caps the damage at a day.

The choices above (platform, models, permissions, system location) were
confirmed by the repo owner on 2026-07-13; no open questions remain.

## Gotchas

Failure modes this system actually shipped with, kept because each one is
cheap to reintroduce and expensive to notice. They share a shape: **the
pipeline stays green while quietly doing nothing**. Nothing crashes, no alert
fires, PRs keep appearing from the other work sources — and the only evidence
is money spent on work that was already done. Budget for the fact that an
autonomous system's characteristic failure is not an error; it is a silent,
confident, recurring no-op.

| Trap | What it looks like when it bites | Build it this way instead |
|---|---|---|
| A helper returns non-zero for a legitimately empty result, and the script runs under `set -e` | `[[ -z "$x" ]] && x="$(helper)"` takes the helper's exit status, so the *whole cycle* dies at that line. Here it died two lines before logging the failure it had just detected — nine cycles left nothing behind but a `selection` event and `exit 1`. | A lookup that finds nothing is a normal outcome: return 0 and print nothing. Reserve non-zero for real errors. Assert it at the real call-site shape under `set -e`, not on the function alone — the function looked fine; the *interaction* was the bug. |
| The writer of an event and the reader of it disagree about the key | `attempt-failed` recorded no `repo`/`item`; the blocked extract grouped by exactly those. Every event collapsed into one anonymous group, so **no failed attempt ever blocked anything** — for months, undetected, because each half reads correctly on its own. | Round-trip the contract in a test: write the event, read it back through the real extract, assert the item is blocked. Any log the system reads back is a contract with itself. |
| A model's clean "I can't/needn't do this" is treated as a crash | A `{"status":"blocked"}` report went down the failure path and was filed as `"implementor exited 0"`, throwing away the reason and unblock condition — the entire product of a full model run. So the next cycle bought the same discovery. | A verdict is a result. Persist it with the model's own words (requirement 9a), and note *which* verdict it is (requirement 9b). The log is the system's only memory: a finding you don't write down, you pay for again, on a schedule, forever. |
| Done-ness inferred from one channel | "Done" meant *a merged PR references it*. Work that landed as a direct commit — or before the repo required PRs — has no PR, so it reads as outstanding forever, and the item is re-selected every cycle for as long as it exists. | Don't let one provenance channel be the only proof. Cross-reference the curated register (R12a), and let the agent that actually looks at the repo settle it once (requirement 9a). Prefer evidence from the tree over evidence from process metadata. |
| A rule with two implementations | The dashboard and the Script each computed "blocked". They disagreed, and the dashboard — the very place you would look to spot this bug — showed the wrong answer confidently. | One definition, shared (requirement 34a). If a second consumer needs it, it sources the first, and the shared unit is where the test lives. |
| Identifiers assumed globally unique | `dependabot-alert-1` exists in *every* repo; date-numbered registers collide across repos too. Keying on the id alone makes one repo's block starve another repo's unrelated work. | Key on the scope plus the id (requirement 34). Ask what an id is unique *within* before using it as a key. |
| A contract asserted in one document and required by none | This spec's design notes state the review "writes the `R-NN` cross-reference into each mirrored tech-debt entry" — and `docs/REVIEW-PIPELINE-SPEC.md` never asked for it. Both documents were internally consistent; the system between them was not, and the dedup it justified never worked. | When one component's design depends on another's behaviour, make it a numbered requirement *in the document that builds that component*, and cite it from both sides. Prose describing what another component "does" is a wish, not an interface. |
| A state that can never say "done", read as if it could | `reviewDecision` stays `CHANGES_REQUESTED` after the agent pushes its fix — GitHub won't let a PR's author dismiss a review on their own PR, and the agent *is* the author. So "is there unanswered feedback?" answered from the PR's own state is always yes, forever. The PR is selected, fixed, re-selected, re-fixed, hourly, at Sonnet prices, and every cycle looks like a productive one. | Ask "what would ever change this value?" before keying on it. Where the answer is "nothing we can do", the state cannot be the signal — derive whose turn it is instead (requirement 3c: latest review vs head commit, the same shape as "a later green run supersedes"). A field that can only ever hold one value is not a condition, it is a constant. |
| The formal signal and the substance in different places | The blocking `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review's body read, in full: "Refer to https://…#pullrequestreview-4718691960". All 6.5 KB of actual findings were in a *separate* `COMMENTED` review, by a *different account* — because the agent's own account raised the PR and therefore cannot request changes on it. A gatherer that read only the blocking review would have handed the Implementor the words "Refer to" and called the brief complete. | Gather the whole round, whoever wrote it, and pass it verbatim. When a platform rule (an author cannot review their own PR) forces a workflow to split across accounts, the split is structural and permanent — design for it rather than discovering it in the one review that mattered. |
| A change-detection digest that tracks churn instead of meaning | The no-op short-circuit (requirement 3b) digested the *run id* of each workflow's latest run. `poetic` schedules `sync-framework.yml` at `0 * * * *` — hourly, the same cadence as the pipeline — so that one workflow busted the fingerprint on every single cycle. The feature was installed, tested, logged, green, and saved nothing; the only symptom was the bill it was built to reduce, unchanged. Found by reading the repo's actual cron lines, not by any test. | Digest the *fact the consumer reads*, not the record it lives in. Requirement 15 asks "is this workflow's latest run a failure" — that is the conclusion, not the id. Before digesting a field, ask what changes it and on what cadence; anything that moves on a timer moves faster than the thing you are trying to detect. Then assert the negative (a green rerun changes nothing), because every positive test still passes on the broken version. |
| A cost-control feature that makes cost the *only* thing it protects | Skipping a stage to save money is a decision to do nothing, and doing nothing is what a healthy idle pipeline also looks like. Get the skip condition subtly wrong — a source outside the fingerprint, a failed API call digested as "empty" — and the pipeline stops picking up work while reporting perfect health, forever, because nothing that stands down ever fails. | Make the skip's claim narrow enough to be provable ("nothing changed"), never broad enough to be wrong ("there is no work"). Mark unusable samples rather than degrading them to empty. Cap the whole mechanism with a time-based valve (`none_selected_recheck_hours`) so a gap in coverage is a bounded delay rather than an outage, and pay the occasional wasted run for it — the run you skipped wrongly costs more than the one you ran needlessly. |
| A switch with no way back on | An agent disables the pipeline to edit safely, then dies mid-session — killed, timed out, or just finished and forgetful. The switch stays set. No cycle runs again. Nothing alerts, because "no PRs this week" is exactly what a quiet week looks like, and the operator finds out days later. | Give any deliberate stop an expiry (requirement 2.3), and make indefinite something a human explicitly asks for. Same shape as the stale-lock rule (requirement 1): every mechanism that halts this system needs an answer to "what if whoever set it never comes back?" |
| One state carrying two meanings, where an agent can reason its way out of it | "Blocked" meant both *something is in the way* and *there is nothing to do*. The Co-Ordinator is told to clear blockers that have lifted; it checked an already-done item, correctly found nothing in its way, and logged `unblocked` — returning it to the pool to be rediscovered forever. Every component obeyed its spec exactly. The fix for the previous row *created* this one, and it took a live cycle to see. | Split the states (requirement 9b): `blocked` is clearable by an agent, `void` only by a human. Test that the clear for one cannot fire on the other. **The tell:** if the same fact that ought to make a state permanent is also grounds for clearing it, the state is wrong. Ask of every agent-clearable state: what would the agent have to believe to clear this, and is that belief the reason it exists? |
